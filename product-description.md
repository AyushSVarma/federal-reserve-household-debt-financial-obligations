The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is available at [https://github.com/rearc-data/federal-reserve-household-debt-financial-obligations](https://github.com/rearc-data/federal-reserve-household-debt-financial-obligation).

## Main Overview
The household Debt Service Ratio (DSR) is the ratio of total required household debt payments to total disposable income.

The DSR is divided into two parts. The Mortgage DSR is total quarterly required mortgage payments divided by total quarterly disposable personal income. The Consumer DSR is total quarterly scheduled consumer debt payments divided by total quarterly disposable personal income. The Mortgage DSR and the Consumer DSR sum to the DSR.

Quarterly values for the Debt Service Ratio are available from 1980 forward.

The Financial Obligations Ratio is a broader measure than the Debt Service Ratio. It includes rent payments on tenant-occupied property, auto lease payments, homeowners' insurance, and property tax payments. These statistics are obtained from the [National Income and Product Accounts](http://www.bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm).
